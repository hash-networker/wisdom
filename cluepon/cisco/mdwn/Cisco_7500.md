**Cisco 7500 Series modular router**

The Cisco 7500 was developed in the early 1990s as an evolution of the [7000](/7000 "wikilink") series. This box has pluggable adaptors (PAs) into Versatile Interface Processors (VIPs) instead of one solid linecard. Also this model contains a Route Switch Processor (RSP) which is the routing processor and the switching processor combined on one card.

Its backplane, the CyBus, runs at double the speed (1.2Â Gbps) of the 7000's CxBus.

A later variant and current shipping chassis also include a TDM backplane bus to allow hairpinning of DS0 channels. These chassis can be recognised by the 'MX' suffix.

The 7576 is actually two routers sharing a common chassis and PSUs, with the restriction that there can only be one RSP per router. The CyBus connects to slots in the following combinations: 0/1/3/5, 2/4, 8/10/12 & 9/11.

-   [7505](/7505 "wikilink") (EOL/EOS Since April 12 2005) - 5 slots, 1 RSP, 1 Power, 1 CyBus
-   [7507](/7507 "wikilink") - 7 slots, 2 RSP, 2 Power, 2 CyBus
