There are many options that can be configured on a 65xx/76xx to rate-limit traffic that is harmful to the router.

This page will attempt to explain some 'suggested' community defaults and the reasoning behind them.

| mls rate-limit all ttl-failure <number> <burst> | global | Limits ttl failure packets generated by the RP | There are apparently many devices out there that send packets out with a TTL that is far too low to make it to the destination. This command will ensure that your RP does not get overloaded by sending out too many TTL exceeded packets. A number of 100 and a burst of 10 seems to work well without having any untoward effects. Setting this parameter too low may cause EBGP sessions to timeout (CSCsa50515). |
