Juniper has a certification program called the Juniper Networks Technical Certification Program (JNTCP). The program is broken down into two tracks: One focused towards service provider environments and a second focused towards enterprise environments. Several certifications are available within each track customized to particular hardware platforms. The four primary certifications available from Juniper in order of difficulty are as follows:

-   Juniper Networks Certified Internet Associate ([JNCIA](/JNCIA "wikilink"))
-   Juniper Networks Certified Internet Specialist ([JNCIS](/JNCIS "wikilink"))
-   Juniper Networks Certified Internet Professional ([JNCIP](/JNCIP "wikilink"))
