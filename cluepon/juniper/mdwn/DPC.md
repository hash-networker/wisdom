The Juniper DPC is an integrated FPC+PIC for the [MX-series](/MX-series "wikilink"), designed to allow denser configurations of Ethernet interfaces.

DPCs come in two flavors, DPC-R (with full layer-3 routing features), and DPC-X (with layer 2.5 features such as VPLS/VPWS but no L3VPN functionality). The DPC-X are currently 25-33% cheaper than their DPC-R counterparts.
