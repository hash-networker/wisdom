A P-1GE-LH was being used in an M5. Appropriate care wasn't used in removing the PIC from the router, causing one of the taller components on the bottom of the board to catch on the front of the router. In this case, it was an inductor used on the optics. A solder blob over the pads and the PIC worked fine. Absolutely not recommended, unless the vendor you bought it from refuses to admit he broke the PIC.
