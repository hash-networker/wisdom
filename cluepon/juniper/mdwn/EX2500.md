To get a 10G ToR switch to market for demanding customers Juniper is OEMing the BNT 10G ToR switch which has identical stats (24 ports of GigE/10GE SFP/SFP+ or direct-attach cables). Initially the switch runs BNT's IOS-like operating system. It is unclear if Juniper will port JunOS to this platform or start work on it's own ToR 10G switch that will run JunOS.
