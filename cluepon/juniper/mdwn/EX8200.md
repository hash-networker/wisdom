The 8200 series core switches are Ethernet switches that offer modular connections via linecards. There are two flavors of 8200 chassis, the 8208 which is a smaller flavor with eight modular slots. The 8216 is a taller chassis with 16 modular line card slots.

Hardware of both platforms consist of 2 Routing Engines, and switch interface boards (SIB). The 8208 uses a single SIB while the 8208 uses eight SIBs located in the back of the chassis. The SIBs between the 8208 and 8216 are not interchangeable.
