The term FPC can refer to either the classic type-1 FPC for M20/M40 series routers, or to any FPC on any series router. On M40e/M160 and higher series routers, the classic FPC is referred to as FPC1, to disambiguate it from other types of FPCs.

The classic FPC card does not have any physical mechanism for hot insertion of PICs. The intended design for PIC insertions is to power off and remove the FPC, insert the PICs, and secure them using small screws on the bottom of the FPC. These screws also hold the blank PIC faceplates in place, but are often the first things lost in normal operation.
