While Juniper provides a variety of optics options (SX/LH/LX/T (copper)) for their routers and PIC's that use SFP transceivers (e.g. P/PE-1GE-SFP or M7i) users may still desire to use specialty optics from third-party manufacturers to create WDM or single-fiber links.

Juniper routers do allow the use of non-Juniper SFP transceivers. Keep in mind, though, that JTAC may require that you remove the non-Juniper components to facilitate troubleshooting.

The Juniper QFX3500 requires a Juniper eeprom for the SFP/SFP+ to create an interface on the device.
