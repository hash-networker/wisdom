Juniper "IP Processor" is a commercial name for the key (packet L3 lookup) ASIC for the original Juniper M40 product. Internally known as "C-chip", this ASIC was a part of 3-piece [ABC chipset](/ABC_chipset "wikilink") constellation that proved hardware-based packet forwarding possible and led to initial commercial success of Juniper Networks.

The name "IP Processor" was also used in the follow-up products, such as "IP Processor II" (internally known as CF-chip). Juniper also sparingly uses "IP Processor" tag to refer to later generations of packet processor engines developed in-house.
