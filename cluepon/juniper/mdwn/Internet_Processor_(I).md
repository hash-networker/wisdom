Juniper "IP Processor" is a commercial name for the key (packet L3 lookup) ASIC for the original Juniper M40 product. Internally known as "C-chip", this ASIC was a part of 3-piece [ABC chipset](/ABC_chipset "wikilink") constellation that proved hardware-based packet forwarding possible and led to initial commercial success of Juniper Networks.

The Internet Processor I was only produced for the [M40](/M40 "wikilink") and [M20](/M20 "wikilink") platforms, and was followed with upgrades [Switch Boards](/Switch_Board "wikilink") for both, featuring the [Internet Processor II](/Internet_Processor_II "wikilink").

Juniper also sparingly uses "IP Processor" tag to refer to later generations of packet processor engines developed in-house.
