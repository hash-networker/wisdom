Comes with two fixed 10/100MBps ethernet and either two fixed T1/E1 interfaces or two serial interfaces. Licensing may only include certain ports depending on part number purchased.

Has a suspiciously large blanking panel on the front of the router, and a spare PCI slot in line with the WAN card, which may or may not allow some form of interface addition down the track.

A maximum of 256MB ram per slot is recognized.
