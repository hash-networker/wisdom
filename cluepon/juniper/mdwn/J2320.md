Two models offered: J2320-JH with hardware crypto, and J2320-JB-SC with software crypto, and only 256MB of RAM.

This model has interchangeable hardware with the SSG320, and a license option is available to change between JUNOS and ScreenOS.

Unlike the J4350 and J6350, the J2320 contains no high-speed PCI-Express-based "EPIM" slots, only shared PCI-based "PIM" slots.

This router was made available in JUNOS 8.4, in August 2007.

Contrary to what this page used to claim, the motherboard \*does\* boot with 1GB dimms. At least the Kingston model KVR400X64C3A/1G (1GB PC3200 CL3 DIMM) dimms work.
