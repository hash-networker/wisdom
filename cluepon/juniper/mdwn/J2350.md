Two models offered: J2350-JH with hardware crypto, and J2350-JB-SC with software crypto, and only 256MB of RAM.

This model has interchangeable hardware with the SSG350, and a license option is available to change between JUNOS and ScreenOS.

Unlike the J4350 and J6350, the J2350 contains no high-speed PCI-Express-based "ePIM" slots, only shared PCI-based "PIM" slots.

This router was made available in JUNOS 8.4, in August 2007.
