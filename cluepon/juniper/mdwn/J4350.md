The hardware is the same as the [Juniper Netscreen SSG 520/SSG 520M Appliance](http://www.juniper.net/products_and_services/firewall_slash_ipsec_vpn/ssg_500_series/index.html). [Image:J4350-1.jpg](/Image:J4350-1.jpg "wikilink")
4x DDR-RAM banks, 1x CF right next to a 40pin pin-header (IDE??), P4 CPU (Celeron 2.53Ghz) with passive cooler, 144pin mini-pci socket. Seems like this is for the hardware VPN accelerator module. 2 very quiet fans at the back
