The Juniper Networks Certified Internet Associate certification is the first but optional step in the Enterprise Routing track of their program.

An individual can choose to bypass this step and proceed directly to the first required examination, the JNCIS-ER.

The JNCIA-ER focuses predominantly on the operation and configuration of J-Series routers and JunOS, with a lesser focus on M7i/M10. This knowledge establishes a decent baseline for any individual who intends to operate Juniper equipment. The exam focusses on areas including basic operation of routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, RIP), route filtering, firewalls and the J-Web interface. While the exam does not get into complex configuration issues, it certainly requires the individual to have some level of operational experience with IP networking.

This exam is not required, but is recommended for those who lack a familiarity with the Juniper enterprise product line but have some IP networking experience.

While this exam may be compared to the Cisco CCNA, the JNCIA-ER exam focuses on current operational practices rather than concepts that are no longer used today (Example: CCNA covers classful routing).
