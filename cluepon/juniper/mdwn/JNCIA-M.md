The Juniper Networks Certified Internet Associate certification is the first but optional step in the M/T track of their program.

An individual can choose to bypass this step and proceed directly to the first required examination, the JNCIS-M.

The JNCIA focuses on Juniper routers traditional architecture, components and JunOS. This knowledge establishes a decent baseline for any individual who intends to operate Juniper equipment. Additional areas of study include routing protocols (BGP, ISIS, OSPF), prefix-filtering, firewalls, Multicast and MPLS. While the exam does not get into complex configuration issues, it certainly requires the individual to have some level of operational experience with IP networking.

This exam is not required, but is recommended for those who lack a familiarity with the Juniper product line but have some IP networking experience.

While this exam may be compared to the Cisco CCNA, the JNCIA-M exam focuses on current operational practices rather than concepts that are no longer used today (Example: CCNA covers classful routing).
