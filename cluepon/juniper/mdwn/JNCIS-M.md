The Juniper Networks Certified Internet Specialist certification is the first required exam before proceeding to the JNCIP-M and JNCIE-M. This exam is also used in recertification for both the JNCIP-M and JNCIE-M.

This exam focuses on an in-depth knowledge of IP networking on the Juniper M series platform. While the JNCIA-M spent some time focusing on hardware and architecture, the JNCIS-M stresses routing technologies.

A very good understanding of BGP, IS-IS, OSPF, PIM, MSDP, RSVP, MPLS, LDP, IPv6, firewall filters, remote authentication (RADIUS/TACACS) and L2/L3vpns is required to pass this exam.
