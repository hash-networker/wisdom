Created in order to repair EX switches when they came out, this tool is a powerful way to make all Juniper boxes repaired regardless of the Junos version you're using.

-   Is this the *official* Juniper supported after-market repair kit for $750, or the same thing you can buy "Grey Market" for $5 ??
