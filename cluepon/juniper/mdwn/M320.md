The [M320](/M320 "wikilink") ([Codename:](/codenames "wikilink") *Sinatra*) is a member of the [M-series](/M-series "wikilink") line, but is really just a physically larger version of the [T320](/T320 "wikilink") internally. This gives it the ability to utilize a greater number of ports, particularly existing [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink") and [type-2](/type-2 "wikilink") ports, but the same [FPC (generic)](/FPC_(generic) "wikilink") [type-3](/type-3 "wikilink") and bandwith density as the T320. It is based on the [gibson architecture](/gibson_architecture "wikilink"), but is not upgradable to multichassis operation.

The M320's release as a replacement for the older technology of the M160 is very similar to the M40e's release as a replacement for the older technology of the M40. The bandwidth capacity is doubled over the M160 ([type-3](/FPC_type-3 "wikilink") FPCs for the M320 support 2 PICs instead of only 1), preventing this router from being the M160e.

Innovations
-----------

The M320 router was the first to ship with the [RE-4.0](/RE-4.0 "wikilink") (1.6GHz) Routing Engine. This Routing Engine was later made available for the [T-series](/T-series "wikilink") line as well. The M320 is also the first router to with four (4) power supplies, enabling it to use AC power where previous routers of this size could not.
