The [MX240](/MX240 "wikilink") ([Codename:](/codenames "wikilink") *Hermes*) became the third member of the MX-Series family, and was originally designed as a competitor to the Cisco 6506/7606 and Alcatel 7750 SR7 routers. Currently it is mostly positioned against A7750SR7 (IOM3) and Cisco ASR9006.

The MX240 has 4 horizontal front-end slots, one (1) of which is reserved for switch control board (with onboard RE-1300 or RE-2000 routing engine), and three (3) of which are available for physical interfaces or second SCB (for redundancy; with onboard RE). The MX240 is 5RU high, and under 800mm deep, with side-to-side airflow.

As is the case with other MX-series systems, MX240 chassis is upgradeable and supports 1st gen (40G/slot) DPC cards as well as 2nd gen (120G/slot) MPC cards. The upgraded Mx480 system is also referred to as MX240 3D.
