The [MX480](/MX480 "wikilink") ([Codename:](/codenames "wikilink") *Calypso*) is the second member of the MX-Series family, and is designed as a competitor to the Cisco 6506/7606 and Alcatel 7750 SR7 routers.

The MX480 has 8 horizontal front-end slots, two (2) of which are reserved for [switch control boards](/switch_control_board "wikilink") (with onboard [RE-1300](/RE-1300 "wikilink") or [RE-2000](/RE-2000 "wikilink") routing engines), and six (6) of which are available for physical interfaces. The MX480 is 8RU high, and under 800mm deep, with side-to-side airflow.

As is the case with other MX-series systems, MX480 chassis is upgradeable and supports 1st gen (40G/slot) DPC cards as well as 2nd gen (120G/slot) MPC cards.

Tips
----

It should be noted that the MX480 runs in "Triton" (i.e. layer-2-only) mode by default, regardless of the type of linecards installed. "set chassis network-services ip" is required to change to normal "ip" mode in order to use the full capabilities of "-R" cards.
