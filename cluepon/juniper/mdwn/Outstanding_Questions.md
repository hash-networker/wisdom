-   On the M40, Juniper says that in order to upgrade the Routing Engine from 1.0 to 2.0 you need to replace the Routing Engine Housing. A visual inspection doesn't show any difference between these housings. Is this upgrade really "required", or did Juniper just think it would be easier to have customers insert a new housing rather than futz with the innards?

Some of the wiring is different .. in the original M40's have an RE different to the teknor RE and came in 2 bits. The Teknor does not need the 2nd bit hence the difference in the housing (or "hump")

-   What happens if you insert a M5 FEB into an M10 chassis? Is the M5 FEB the same electronics at the M10 FEB? Is this part number software locked to allow functionality on only the top FPC?

The M10 becomes an M5 - the board is the same, just without the electronics to allow for "FPC1" .. i.e. all PIC's in slots 4-7 won't work
