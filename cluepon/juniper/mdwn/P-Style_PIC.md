The P-Style PIC was the first PIC style produced by Juniper, for its [M40](/M40 "wikilink") router. It was later adopted for use in the [M20](/M20 "wikilink") router, which utilizes the same [FPCs](/FPC "wikilink") and [PICs](/PIC "wikilink") as the [M40](/M40 "wikilink"). Today the [M20](/M20 "wikilink") is the only currently produced product which utilizes the P-Style PIC. The P-Style interface is currently used only on [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink") PICs intended for use in the classic [FPC](/FPC "wikilink").

One of the biggest problems with the P-Style PIC is the lack of a mechanism to physically remove the PIC from an FPC, short of pulling out the FPC (disabling it and any other PICs on it in the process) and pulling the P-Style PIC free by hand. The P-Style PIC attaches to the [FPC](/FPC "wikilink") via 2 small screws, which are easily lost and require a P2 screwdriver for proper operation. This is very similar to the [Cisco](/Cisco "wikilink") VIP architecture from their 7500 series routers.

It has been suggested that Juniper might be able to phase out the [P-Style PIC](/P-Style_PIC "wikilink") altogether in favor of the [PE-Style PIC](/PE-Style_PIC "wikilink"), by making minor physical modifications to the [FPC](/FPC "wikilink"), and issuing a new [Craft](/Craft "wikilink") interface for the [M20](/M20 "wikilink") which includes per-PIC offline/online buttons. However, based on the [M20](/M20 "wikilink")'s age and continued use of components which are not shared with other product lines, it seems more likely that the [M20](/M20 "wikilink") will simply be [EOLed](/EOL "wikilink") when a replacement product is available.
