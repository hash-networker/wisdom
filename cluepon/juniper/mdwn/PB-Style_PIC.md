The PB-Style [PIC](/PIC "wikilink") was the second style introduced by Juniper, originally for the [M160](/M160 "wikilink") platform. The PB style was later adopted for the [M40e](/M40e "wikilink") and [M320](/M320 "wikilink"), and continues to be used for [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink") and [type-2](/type-2 "wikilink") [PICs](/PIC "wikilink") on the [T-series](/T-series "wikilink") platforms.

The PB-Style PICs are used for both [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink") and [type-2](/type-2 "wikilink") interfaces. When used for [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink"), plastic "rails" as used as spacers to expand the width of the card to fit the PB faceplate, when used for [type-2](/type-2 "wikilink"), the PIC electronics are physically wider than the [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink"). The [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink") electronics are the same as the [P-Style PIC](/P-Style_PIC "wikilink") and [PE-Style PIC](/PE-Style_PIC "wikilink"), only the faceplate and plastic rails differ.

PB-Style PICs use two large thumbscrews handle insertion and removal of the PIC within the FPC.
