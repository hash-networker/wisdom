The PE-Style mechanical interface is similar to the [P-Style](/P-Style_PIC "wikilink"). The dimensions are precisely the same; in fact, the only change is the addition of an ejector lever on the front panel, and an ejector mechanism attached to a metal plate which is added to the bottom of the PIC. The actual electronics on a PE PIC are precisely the same as a P PIC.

The PE-Style PIC was originally created for use in the [M5](/M5 "wikilink") and [M10](/M10 "wikilink") product lines, which have integrated [FPCs](/FPC "wikilink"). The ejector system allows for the PIC to be physically removed without pulling out the FPC, which would be impossible on the M5/M10. The [M7i](/M7i "wikilink") and [M10i](/M10i "wikilink"), which replaced the [M5](/M5 "wikilink") and [M10](/M10 "wikilink") products respectively, have continued to use the PE-Style PIC. The PE-Style interface is currently used only on [type-1](/type-1 "wikilink") PICs intended for use in chassis with an integrated [FPC](/FPC "wikilink").
