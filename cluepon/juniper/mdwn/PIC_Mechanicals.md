Juniper PICs can be categorized into the following six (6) styles of mechanical interfaces. These mechanical interfaces are usually related to the specific product and type/bandwidth of the PIC, but sometimes span multiple products and FPC types.

-   [P](/P-Style_PIC "wikilink") (M20/M40)
-   [I](/I-Style_PIC "wikilink") (M20/M40)
-   [PE](/PE-Style_PIC "wikilink") (M5/M10/M7i/M10i)
-   [PB](/PB-Style_PIC "wikilink") (M40e/M160/M320/T-series)
-   [IB](/IB-Style_PIC "wikilink") (M40e/M160)
-   [PC](/PC-Style_PIC "wikilink") (M320/T-series)
