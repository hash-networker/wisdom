P- Style pics are officially made for the M20 and M40 series, they also work in the M40e, M160, M320 when using a FPC1. Unofficially these pics also work with the M5 and M10 routers, however without any eject handle its very hard to get the pics removed. There are several hacks: [M20_PIC_hotswapping](/M20_PIC_hotswapping "wikilink") to partially solve this.
