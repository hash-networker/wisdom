The RE-1.0 was featured only in the M40, and will not function in any other Juniper router. It consists of a Motorola CPV-5000 CompactPCI blade with a Pentium II 233 MHz processor and 256 MB of 72-pin EDO RAM. The Motorola board has a single on-board Ethernet interface. Juniper added a CompactPCI Fast Ethernet card since a second Ethernet interface was required (one to the PFE and one to the Craft Interface).

The routing engines of an M40 are always found mated to a "routing engine housing" designed to support it. Since the RE-1.0 is supported on the M40 only, you will always find it in this configuration.
