[thumb|right|Switch Fabric Module (SFM)](/Image:SFM_Front.jpg "wikilink")

The Switch Fabric Module (SFM) was first introduced as the the [Switch Board](/Switch_Board "wikilink") for the [M160](/M160 "wikilink") router, and later adopted for use on the [M40e](/M40e "wikilink"). The SFM was also the first [Switch Board](/Switch_Board "wikilink") to separate the functionality of the switch fabric from other functions previously integrated onto the [Switch Board](/Switch_Board "wikilink") in older models, such as the reference clocks, into the [MCS](/MCS "wikilink") and [PCG](/PCG "wikilink") components. This was done in order to allow the [M160](/M160 "wikilink") to handle four (4) times the capacity of the [M40](/M40 "wikilink"), using the same packet processing architecture, by running up to 4 SFMs simultaneously.

When the [M160](/M160 "wikilink") architecture was later used to produce the [M40e](/M40e "wikilink"), the SFM model was returned to 1 active + 1 standby, in order to match the capacity of the original [M40](/M40 "wikilink").
