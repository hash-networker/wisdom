Common Form-factor Modules
==========================

Common form-factor modules are a standard type of module for the SRX3000 series which can be a combination of IOC/NPC/SPC cards.

IOCs can only be in CFM slots 1 through 6 NPCs can only be in CFM slots 10 through 12 SPCs can be in any CFM slot

Switch Fabric Board (SFB)
-------------------------

Network Processing Cards
------------------------

Security Processing Cards
-------------------------

The Security Processing Card is where stateful firewall, IPSec and IDP processing is done

Input/Output Cards
------------------

Input/Output Card (IOC) contain the physical interfaces on them.

The SRX-3600 supports the same IOCs as the SRX-3400
