Have you lost the original screws and tried to use regular 4-40 screws to attach blank faceplates & PICs to FPC's? You'll notice that the fit leaves something to be desired - the blank faceplates wobble, for example.

The correct screw is a 4-40 x 1/4 phillips flattop with an undercut, zinc plated steel.
