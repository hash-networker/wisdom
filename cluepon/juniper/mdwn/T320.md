The [T320](/T320 "wikilink") ([Codename:](/codenames "wikilink") *Bombay*) is a member of the [T-series](/T-series "wikilink") line and is effectively a smaller (1/3rd rack) version of the [T640](/T640 "wikilink"). It is based on the [Gibson architecture](/Gibson_architecture "wikilink") but is not upgradable to multichassis operation.

Althought it is more compact, one notable quirk of the T320 is that due to space requirements it uses eight (8) vertical 2-port FPCs, rather than the traditional model of turning an existing 4-port FPC onto its side. This results in a significantly increased number of FPCs needed compared to other platforms, and also presents sparing issues since the T320 needs its own style of FPCs.
