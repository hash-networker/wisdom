Juniper TX Matrix is the name for the fabric shelf that can interconnect up to four [T640](/T640 "wikilink") routers into a cluster. A system connecting two routers is called TX2; a system connecting four routers is called TX4. Juniper shipped first TX Matrix systems in 2004.

Multichassis system operation requires the fabric planes in the constituent routers ([SIBs](/SIB "wikilink")) to be externalized and replaced with optical versions featuring multiple lanes of surface lasers (VCSELs). When a T-series router is plugged into TX Matrix, fabric switching happens inside the Matrix shelf, which also runs a centralized control plane for the cluster.

Due to cost implications of using the optical backplane, router clusters are mostly popular with Tier 1 operators and high-end enterprise customers.
