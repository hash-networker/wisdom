'''Juniper Networks''' is a telecommunications equipment company. It is a provider of IP networking and security solutions. Juniper partners with Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, and Nokia Siemens Networks to provide IP/MPLS network solutions to customers. As of August 1st, 2005, Juniper Networks had approximately 3,400 employees worldwide.

== Products ==
Juniper's router products include [[T-series]], [[M-series]], [[MX-series]], [[E-series]], and [[J-series]] families of [[router]]s, and the [[SDX]] service deployment system.

* ''T-series'' routers are large [[core router]]s.
* ''M-series'' routers are multiservice core/edge routers.
* ''MX-series'' routers are ethernet services edge routers.
* ''E-series'' routers are [[broadband]] [[edge router]]s.
* ''J-Series'' routers are small premise routers.
* ''NetScreen'' hardware [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]].
* ''Secure Access'' SSL VPN gateways.
* ''IDP'' Intrusion detection and prevention appliances.
* ''VF-series'' [[Session Border Controller]]s.

The E series routers run the [[JUNOSe]] operating software. The E series was developed by Unisphere, which Juniper acquired in 2002 from Siemens.

The J, M, MX, and T series routers are based on a common architecture and the Juniper operating system [[JUNOS]].

While the E, M, and T series are all high speed devices capable of terminating multiple broadband optical connections, the J series is much lower in speed. Capable of terminating DS3 (45 Mbit/s) and slower lines, this product line is aimed at corporate branch offices and service provider premise equipment. With the J-series, Juniper extends its target market from service providers to the enterprise market.

NetScreen firewalls provide wire speed firewall and [[VPN]] encryption service.

Secure Access products provide SSL based VPN services to remote users without specialized clients. This product was originally designed by Neoteris. Netscreen acquired Neoteris prior to Juniper's acquisition of Netscreen.

IDP products provide detection and interception of malicious network traffic via stateful analysis. 

VF-series session border controllers provide scalability and security processing for VoIP traffic. The VF series was developed by Kagoor Networks which was acquired by Juniper in May of 2005.

==History==
Juniper was incorporated in February 1996 in California and was reincorporated in March 1998 in Delaware. Juniper went public on June 25, 1999.

Juniper acquired NetScreen Technologies in April of 2004 for 3.4 billion dollars.

Juniper acquired Kagoor in April of 2005 for 65.7 million dollars.

==Financial Information==
Juniper trades on the Nasdaq National Market with a ticker symbol of JNPR. As of February 28, 2005, there were approximately 544 million shares of common stock outstanding. Juniper announced a two-for-one stock split on April 13, 2000. Juniper announced a three-for-one stock split on November 16, 1999.
